# Bayesian Analysis: Modeling for Medical Insurance Costs Bayesian

To create optimal medical insurance products, insurers rely on historical data to estimate individual medical expenses. This data allows for precise pricing models, strategic insurance planning, and effective portfolio management. The primary goal is to accurately predict insurance costs using various predictor variables.
